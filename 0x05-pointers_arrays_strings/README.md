0) 0-reset_to_98.c - Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.



Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);
1)1-swap.c - Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.



Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
2. 2-strlen.c - Write a function that returns the length of a string.



Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);
3. 3-puts.c - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.



Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.
4. 4-print_rev.c - Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.



Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);
5. 5-rev_string.c - Write a function that reverses a string.



Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);
6. 6-puts2.c - Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.



Prototype: void puts2(char *str);
7. 7-puts_half.c - Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.



Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);

The function should print the second half of the string

If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2
8. 8-print_array.c - Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.



Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);

where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed

Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space

The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array

You are allowed to use printf
9. 9-strcpy.c - Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);

Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.



Return value: the pointer to dest

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcpy. Run man strcpy to learn more.
