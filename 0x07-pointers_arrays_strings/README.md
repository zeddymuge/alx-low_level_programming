##0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## 1. 0-memset.c
Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.



Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);

The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b

Returns a pointer to the memory area s

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memset. Run man memset to learn more.
